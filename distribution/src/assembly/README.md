## Minimum Requirements

## asconfig.json

Add a file named [*asconfig.json*](https://github.com/BowlerHatLLC/vscode-as3mxml/wiki/asconfig.json) to the root of your project to enable the ActionScript & MXML extension.

A sample *asconfig.json* file for an Apache Royale project appears below:

``` json
{
	"compilerOptions": {
		"targets": [
			"JSRoyale"
		],
		"source-map": true
	},
	"files":
	[
		"src/HelloRoyale.mxml"
	]
}
```

Here's another sample *asconfig.json* file for a pure ActionScript project targeting Adobe AIR on mobile:

``` json
{
	"config": "airmobile",
	"compilerOptions": {
		"output": "bin/HelloAIR.swf"
	},
	"application": "src/HelloAIR-app.xml",
	"files": [
		"src/HelloAIR.as"
	],
	"airOptions": {
		"android": {
			"output": "bin/HelloAIR.apk",
			"signingOptions": {
				"storetype": "pkcs12",
				"keystore": "android_certificate.p12"
			}
		},
		"ios": {
			"output": "bin/HelloAIR.ipa",
			"signingOptions": {
				"storetype": "pkcs12",
				"keystore": "ios_certificate.p12",
				"provisioning-profile": "example.mobileprovision"
			}
		}
	}
}
```
